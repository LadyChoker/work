    Router-LSAs are the Type 1 LSAs.  Each router in an area originates
    a router-LSA.  The LSA describes the state and cost of the router's
    links (i.e., interfaces) to the area.  All of the router's links to
    the area must be described in a single router-LSA.

    Network-LSAs are the Type 2 LSAs.  A network-LSA is originated for
    each broadcast and NBMA network in the area which supports two or
    more routers.  The network-LSA is originated by the network's
    Designated Router.  The LSA describes all routers attached to the
    network, including the Designated Router itself.  The LSA's Link
    State ID field lists the IP interface address of the Designated
    Router.

    by area border routers. Summary-LSAs describe inter-area
    destinations.  For details concerning the construction of summary-
    LSAs, see Section 12.4.3.

    Type 3 summary-LSAs are used when the destination is an IP network.
    In this case the LSA's Link State ID field is an IP network number
    (if necessary, the Link State ID can also have one or more of the
    network's "host" bits set; see Appendix E for details). W

    ID.  (To see why it is necessary to advertise the location of each
    ASBR, consult Section 16.4.)  Other than the difference in the Link

    AS boundary routers, and describe destinations external to the AS.
    For details concerning the construction of AS-external-LSAs, see
    Section 12.4.3.

    AS-external-LSAs usually describe a particular external destination.
    For these LSAs the Link State ID field specifies an IP network
    number (if necessary, the Link State ID can also have one or more of
    the network's "host" bits set; see Appendix E for details).  AS-
    external-LSAs are also used to describe a default route.  Default
    routes are used when no specific route exists to the destination.
    When describing a default route, the Link State ID is always set to
    DefaultDestination (0.0.0.0) and the Network Mask is set to 0.0.0.0.
