RFC 3209     RSVP-TE

4.2. Label Request Object

   The Label Request Class is 19.  Currently there are three possible
   C_Types.  Type 1 is a Label Request without label range.  Type 2 is a
   label request with an ATM label range.  Type 3 is a label request
   with a Frame Relay label range.  The LABEL_REQUEST object formats are
   shown below.

      Reserved (Res)

         This field is reserved.  It MUST be set to zero on transmission
         and MUST be ignored on receipt.

      L3PID

         an identifier of the layer 3 protocol using this path.
         Standard Ethertype values are used.

      M

         Setting this bit to one indicates that the node is capable of
         merging in the data plane

      Minimum VPI (12 bits)

         This 12 bit field specifies the lower bound of a block of
         Virtual Path Identifiers that is supported on the originating
         switch.  If the VPI is less than 12-bits it MUST be right
         justified in this field and preceding bits MUST be set to zero.

      Minimum VCI (16 bits)

         This 16 bit field specifies the lower bound of a block of
         Virtual Connection Identifiers that is supported on the
         originating switch.  If the VCI is less than 16-bits it MUST be
         right justified in this field and preceding bits MUST be set to
         zero.

      Maximum VPI (12 bits)

         This 12 bit field specifies the upper bound of a block of
         Virtual Path Identifiers that is supported on the originating
         switch.  If the VPI is less than 12-bits it MUST be right
         justified in this field and preceding bits MUST be set to zero.

      Maximum VCI (16 bits)

         This 16 bit field specifies the upper bound of a block of
         Virtual Connection Identifiers that is supported on the
         originating switch.  If the VCI is less than 16-bits it MUST be

         zero.
