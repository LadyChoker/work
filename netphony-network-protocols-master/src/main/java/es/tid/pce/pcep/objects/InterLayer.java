 * 3.1. INTER-LAYER Object

   The INTER-LAYER object is optional and can be used in PCReq and PCRep
   messages.

   In a PCReq message, the INTER-LAYER object indicates whether inter-
   layer path computation is allowed, the type of path to be computed,
   and whether triggered signaling (hierarchical LSPs per [RFC4206] or
   stitched LSPs per [RFC5150] depending on physical network

   technologies) is allowed. When the INTER-LAYER object is absent from
   a PCReq message, the receiving PCE MUST process as though inter-layer
   path computation had been explicitly disallowed (I-bit set to zero -
   see below).

   In a PCRep message, the INTER-LAYER object indicates whether inter-
   layer path computation has been performed, the type of path that has
   been computed, and whether triggered signaling is used.

   When a PCReq message includes more than one request, an INTER-LAYER
   object is used per request. When a PCRep message includes more than
   one path per request that is responded to, an INTER-LAYER object is
   used per path.

   INTER-LAYER Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA (recommended
   value=18)

   INTER-LAYER Object-Type is to be assigned by IANA (recommended
   value=1)

   The format of the INTER-LAYER object body is as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   I flag (1 bit): The I flag is used by a PCC in a PCReq message to
   indicate to a PCE whether an inter-layer path is allowed. When the I
   flag is set (one), the PCE MAY perform inter-layer path computation
   and return an inter-layer path. When the flag is clear (zero), the
   path that is returned MUST NOT be an inter-layer path.

   The I flag is used by a PCE in a PCRep message to indicate to a PCC
   whether the path returned is an inter-layer path. When the I flag is
   set (one), the path is an inter-layer path. When it is clear (zero),
   the path is contained within a single layer either because inter-
   layer path computation was not performed or because a mono-layer path
   (without any virtual TE link and without any loose hop that spans the
   lower-layer network) was found notwithstanding the use of inter-layer
   path computation.

   M flag (1 bit): The M flag is used by a PCC in a PCReq message to
   indicate to a PCE whether mono-layer path or multi-layer path is

   requested. When the M flag is set (one), multi-layer path is
   requested. When it is clear (zero), mono-layer path is requested.

   The M flag is used by a PCE in a PCRep message to indicate to a PCC
   whether mono-layer path or multi-layer path is returned. When M flag
   is set (one), multi-layer path is returned. When M flag is set (zero),
   mono-layer path is returned.

   If the I flag is clear (zero), the M flag has no meaning and MUST be
   ignored.

   [PCE-INTER-LAYER-REQ] describes two sub-options for mono-layer path.

   - A mono-layer path that is specified by strict hops. The path may
   include virtual TE links.

   - A mono-layer path that includes loose hops that span the lower-
   layer network.

   The choice of this sub-option can be specified by the use of O flag
   in the RP object specified in [RFC5440].

   T flag (1 bit): The T flag is used by a PCC in a PCReq message to
   indicate to a PCE whether triggered signaling is allowed. When the T
   flag is set (one), triggered signaling is allowed. When it is clear
   (zero), triggered signaling is not allowed.

   The T flag is used by a PCE in a PCRep message to indicate to a PCC
   whether triggered signaling is required to support the returned path.
   When the T flag is set (one), triggered signaling is required. When
   it is clear (zero), triggered signaling is not required.

   Note that triggered signaling is used to support hierarchical
   [RFC4206] or stitched [RFC5150] LSPs according to the physical
   attributes of the network layers.

   If the I flag is clear (zero), the T flag has no meaning and MUST be
   ignored.

   Note that the I flag and M flag differ in the following ways. - When
   the I flag is clear (zero), virtual TE links must not be used in path
   computation. In addition, loose hops that span the lower-layer
   network must not be specified. Only regular TE links from the same
   layer may be used.

   - When the I flag is set (one), the M flag is clear (zero), and the T
   flag is set (one), virtual TE links are allowed in path computation.

   In addition, when the O flag of the RP object is set, loose hops that
   span the lower-layer network may be specified. This will initiate
   lower-layer LSP setup, thus inter-layer path is setup even though the
   path computation result from a PCE to a PCC include hops from the
   same layer only.

   - However, when the I flag is set (one), the M flag is clear (zero),
   and the T flag is clear (zero), since triggered signaling is not
   allowed, virtual TE links must not be used in path computation. In
   addition, loose hops that span the lower-layer network must not be
   specified. Therefore, this is equivalent to the I flag being clear
   (zero).

   Reserved bits of the INTER-LAYER object SHOULD be transmitted as zero
   and SHOULD be ignored on receipt. A PCE that forwards a path
   computation request to other PCEs SHOULD preserve the settings of
   reserved bits in the PCReq messages it sends and in the PCRep
   messages it forwards to PCCs.
