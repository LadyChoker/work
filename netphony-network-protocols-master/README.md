The netphony-network-protocols library is an implementation of four networking protocols: 
* **PCEP protocol**: Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) [RFC 5440](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5440). 
* **BGP-LS protocol**: North-Bound Distribution of Link-State and Traffic Engineering Information using BGP  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7752. Support of  BGP-LS Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions 
* **RSVP-TE protocol**: Resource reservation protocol (RSVP) with Traffic Engineering extensions.
* **OSPF-TE protocol**: OSPF Version 2 protocol with Traffic Engineering extensions.

The protocol library can be easily integrated in any software that needs to interact with other software/devices using these protoocols. The library provides the encoding and decoding from java objects to bit-level. Note that, the state machine and set up of sessions is provided by other components, also available in github. 

The PCEP implemnentation has been tested against other PCEP implementations. Commercial implementations (Cisco XTC). Research Implementations (Telecom Italia Implementation, CTTC Implementation and CNIT Implementation) .  

The Netphony BGP-LS implementation is known to interoperate with Telecom Italia Implementation, CTTC Implementation and CNIT Implementation and Juniper MX routers. It is listed in the IETF BGP-LS implemenation report https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution-impl-04  

The library is maintained to be up-to-date to the latest version of the internet-drafts/RFCs. **Contributions are highly welcomed.**

## **Latest news**
- Back to life after some time dormant :-)
- PCEP Message numbers, Object classes and Object types from IANA https://www.iana.org/assignments/pcep/pcep.xhtml by 30th November 2020

## Compilation and use

The library can be built using the maven tool. There is a set of Junit tests included that check the enconding/decoding process . Contributions on expanding the test suite are welcomed.
To build the .jar file and run the tests, clone the repository, go to the main directory and run:
 ```bash
    cd netphony-network-protocols
    mvn package
    mvn install
 ```
 
 To use the library in your application, add the dependency in your pom.xml file:
  ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>es.tid.netphony</groupId>
      <artifactId>network-protocols</artifactId>
      <version>1.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
 ```
 Authors keep also a copy of the artifact in maven central to facilitate the deployment. (*) In process

## How to use the code:

### ENCODING

1-> Create a new instance of the desired message
 ```java
     PCEPRequest message = new PCEPRequest();
 ```
2-> Create instances of the desired constructs or objects and add them to the message
 ```java
     Request req = new Request();
     //RequestParameters
     RequestParameters rp= new RequestParameters();
     rp.setPbit(true);				
     rp.setRequestID(123);		
     rp.setPrio(1);		
     rp.setReopt(false);	
     rp.setBidirect(false);
     rp.setLoose(false);
     req.setRequestParameters(rp);
     //EndPoints
     EndPointsIPv4 ep=new EndPointsIPv4();				
     req.setEndPoints(ep);
     Inet4Address ipp = (Inet4Address)Inet4Address.getByName("172.16.101.101");
     ep.setSourceIP(ipp);
	.....
    message.addRequest(req); 	
 ```
3-> Call encode()
```java
   message.encode();
```
4-> Get bytes and send them!
```java
   out.write(message.getBytes());
   out.flush();
```
## PCEP Protocol and Support

The Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) is used for communications between a PCC and a PCE, or between two PCEs, in compliance with RFC4657.  Such interactions include path computation requests, path computation replies as well as notifications of specific states related to the use of a PCE in the context of MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering. Recent extensions. A good source of PCE material can be found in http://ict-one.eu/pace/public_wiki/mediawiki-1.19.7/index.php?title=Tools

The detail of the messages, objects and TLVs can be found in [click here](doc/PCEP_Support.md)

* RFC 5440: Full compliance
* RFC 5521: Path-key not supported
* RFC 5886: Full compliance
* RFC 6006: Only P2MP END-POINTS Object for IPv4
* RFC 8231: Full compliance
* RFC 8281: Full compliance

#Acknowledgements

The software has been developed by Telefonica I+D Core & Transport Team, led by Juan Pedro Fernandez Palacios, in internal innovation projects and through several EU funded research proyects, which continuously added functionality. The Core & Transport Team group of Telefonica working with the propocols if formed by Juan Pedro Fernandez Palacios (team leader), Victor Lopez, Oscar Gonzalez de Dios, Felipe Jim√©nez, Luis Miguel Contreras, Michel Carnero and Eduardo Yusta. All of them have contributed to the code, either directly of with ideas and as beta-testers. The main maintainer of the code is Oscar Gonzalez de Dios. 

The effort to release as open source of the code was funded by the E.U. CSA PACE. The code has been upgraded in the E.U. projects STRONGEST, PACE, IDEALIST, ACINO and 5GEx, as well as Telefonica Innovation activities.

PCEP and BGP-LS are included as requirement of the MUST Sub-group in TIP.
